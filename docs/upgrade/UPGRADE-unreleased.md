There you can find links to upgrade notes for other versions too.

### Application
- call `Form::isSubmitted()` before `Form::isValid()` ([#1041](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/1041))
    - search for `$form->isValid() && $form->isSubmitted()` and fix the order of calls (in `shopsys/project-base` the wrong order could have been found in `src/Shopsys/ShopBundle/Controller/Front/PersonalDataController.php`):
        ```diff
        - if ($form->isValid() && $form->isSubmitted()) {
        + if ($form->isSubmitted() && $form->isValid()) {
        ```
